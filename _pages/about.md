# About Me

Hi there! I'm Jungwoo Song, a Backend Developer passionate about both designing clean architectures and building robust applications. With a coffee in one hand and code in the other, I explore the art of creating systems that are not only well-structured but also reliable and scalable.

I embrace new technologies with enthusiasm and find joy in continuous learning. What excites me most about software development is crafting solutions that maintain their elegance as they scale. My curiosity drives me to explore different architectural patterns while ensuring robust implementation that stands up to real-world demands.


## Current Focus
- Designing maintainable software architectures
- Building distributed systems at scale
- Implementing event-driven architectures
- Creating robust and resilient applications
