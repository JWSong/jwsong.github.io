Hi there! I'm Jungwoo Song, a Backend Developer who finds inspiration in both writing code and brewing coffee. With a fresh cup of coffee as my constant companion, I'm passionate about designing clean architectures and building robust applications that stand the test of time.
Like the art of brewing a perfect cup, I believe great software requires attention to detail, patience, and continuous refinement. I embrace new technologies with enthusiasm and find joy in the learning process. What excites me most about software development is crafting elegant solutions that scale gracefully while maintaining their core integrity - much like finding that perfect balance in a well-crafted coffee.


## Current Focus
- Designing maintainable software architectures
- Building distributed systems at scale
- Implementing event-driven architectures
- Creating robust and resilient applications
